DESCRIPTION:
       watchlogd is a daemon that rotates backlogs daily, weekly,
       monthly or when a maximum file size is  reached.  It  will
       wake up once or more a day and check if any logs need pro-
       cessing. Old logs can be saved for a number  of  rotations
       and  optionally compressed. The oldest log that is removed
       from the rotational sequence can also  be  emailed  before
       deletion.  A  test  mode can be enabled to debug and trace
       operational  scenarios  without  actually  processing  log
       files.  For  singular  processing  chores,  the non-daemon
       variant watchlog can be run.
