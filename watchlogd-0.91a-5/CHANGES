        * watchlog.c call to pidFetch does not log an error if pid file does
	  not exist since this function is also called when
	  verifying that the daemon is not already running
	  (ie. before daemon runs and if there is no pid file 
	  at that point then this is not an error)

        * log.c does not use a /tmp file for error log trace (for the usual reasons)
	  create a file in /var/lib/watchlogd instead 
	  
	* move unlink to remove error log file
	  thanks to Claus-Justus Heine <claus@momo.math.rwth-aachen.de>
	  for pointing it out
	    
	
0.00 --> 0.91

        * log module will not print *any* msg on
          stdout or stderr if in daemon mode and not test mode 
          instead use verbose mode to get trace in syslog
          and/or set 'mailerrors on' to get mailed a 
          log of error level messages. if in daemon mode and
          test mode then some errorlogfile type errors will
          go to stderr for debuging purposes

        * recognize other exec pathnames like:
          /usr/sbin/watchlogd ./watchlogd

        * update man page

03/05/97 
        * add senderrors {on|off} option for
          global config file /etc/watchlog.conf

        * move errorlogfile handling into log module
          automatically opens errorfile when receives
          first err log msg. logSendErrorLog closes
          file out and attempts to send. errorlogfile
          is opened again on next err log msg

        * verbose for a daemon
          outputs test level log messages to syslog
          at info level and dups error level messages
          to errorlog and prints nothing to stderr. 
          using verbose mode with watchlog  is same
          as test mode

03/04/97
        * config is now loaded before waiting to start
          initial processing in anticipation of other
          global options in /etc/watchlogd.conf for
          start time and intervals

        * check is now checklog and has an off option in 
          anticipation of scanlog {on|off} 

        * verbose (-V) mode now shows same output as test mode
          but operations are actually executed

03/03/97
        * fix parsing of createmode options:

           - use strncpy into known buffer for sscanf for safety
         
           - detect and report the following errors:

               failed sscanf parse!!
               no args
               too many args
               invalid mode
               invalid owner
               invalid group
               valid mode
               valid mode,owner
               valid mode,owner,group
   
           - test mode shows createmode options set (if valid)

        * clean up test mode output for better readability

        * change createmode for /var/log/wtmp (644) and
          /var/log/lastlog (600) in default /etc/watchlog.conf

        * add some basic syslog logging

        * daemon periodically verifies saved pid and shuts down
          if not correct

        * command flags for message mode are all upper case
          (-D -T for debug and test) and debug mode is now available

03/02/97


        * add pid functions used to handle process pid and
          check for previously running daemon

        * dont run under an unrecognized name ie. not watchlog or 
          watchlogd

        * usage display adjusted for both variants watchlog and watchlogd

        * watchlogd detects itself and runs as daemon (without -d flag)

        * change messages levels
          test is now debug and debug is one level lower
          test is used to display trace for operating scenario
          and debug will be used to show info related more to
          code and system issues than to operation.



03/01/97

        * add sendlog {on|off} directive so can locally override
          whether to send out a log but keep a global email addr
          to send other logs to. for example, /var/log/wtmp should
          not be sent since it is binary (not ascii) but will want
          to retain send out removed log behavior from
          /etc/watchlog.conf

          new directive semantics for email addresses are:
          
           sendlogto <emailaddr>

           senderrorsto <emailaddr>

        * test mode shows postrotate script that would be executed
        
        * if in test mode show debug messages on stderr even if a
          mailing address is given for the processing log
 
        * directive to use a max file size to process is 'rotate filesize'
          and maxsize is used to set size in K or M and mazsize is
          not used if rotate is on a calendar interval like: daily,
          weekly, or monthly

        * don't allow processing interval > 24 hrs (must run at least
          once a day since checks are made for 1st of month and 
          1st of week )

        * don't reread config files especially if in daemon mode!


02/28/97

        * add optional parameters for daemon: processing interval and 
          first start time -- if not given ==> start time is now and 
          interval is 24 hrs  
        
        * add daemon mode

	* change command line option characters for --debug and --verbose

	* add option -v --version


02/26/97

	* clean up some syntax of logrotate.c code to
          be more semantically correct

	* add code to try default config file /etc/watchlog.conf
          and or directory /etc/watchlog.d if none specified on command 
          line (which is now optional)

	* change syntax of config file directives to be a more
          meaningful grammar 




from erik troan's logrotate

2.0.2 -> 2.1:
	- Don't output state information for logs that have never been
	  rotated (better then 1900-1-0)
	- Accept 1900-1-0 as time 0
	
2.0.1 -> 2.0.2:
	- I have no idea :-(

2.0 -> 2.0.1:
	- ignore files in included directories which end with ~, .rpmorig, or
	  .rpmsave
